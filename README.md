## Project Two Reflection

- Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, we were given the skeleton of a training algorithm that strove to find the best route to buried treasure given a tiled environment and an agent that stepped through that environment, learning via reinforcement, scored based on the efficiency of its path. We were given the environment, then we were tasked with implementing a deep Q-learning algorithm to help the agent learn from its previous runs to find a successful, efficient path through the environment using experience recall.

- Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
    - What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
    - How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
    - What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Computer scientists strive to find ways to use computers to perform tasks that humans shouldn't, or in this case *couldn't* do manually. Using machine learning, we are able to teach agents like the treasure-seeking one to perform difficult, repetitive tasks, allowing us to benefit and find performant ways to automate intensive functions, and in many case make all of our lives easier. We approach problems by trying to find dynamic, performant methods to replace human effort. We start from the most basic operations, giving simple scripted commands, and move on to bigger, more complex systems that in this case can learn and grow without having to rely on human logic. 

Of course, when creating agents that can adapt to constraints and find solutions to problems based on their own, unrelatable logic, there is huge potential for ethical concerns, as we are now seeing with the sudden explosion of AI services and tools. With powerful tools, there is great potential to create a lawless, unmitigated digital landscape. We must ensure as a collective, despite potential monetary gains, to protect human users, their data, and livelihoods so that no individuals or groups of people are unfairly harmed or affected by models that may not be fully vetted.
